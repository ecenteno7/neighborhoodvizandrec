### Description
This application is a full-stack web application that is a recommendation system for users to find similiar neighborhoods to that which they might enjoy in a city they are familiar with. The source code is structured as follows:
- flask/ : back-end code directory
  - app.py: main flask server application driver for API endpoints
  - traffic.py: code to query db for traffic data slicing
  - knn.py: code to run knn classification model
  - maps.py: code to query Mapquest/Google Maps API's for location data
  - neighborhood_boundary_simplification.py: code creates polygon shapes for neighborhoods to simplify proximity searches
  - neighborhood_methods.py: code used to categorize neighborhoods using raw point of interest counts
  - knn_input.csv: csv file produced as an output of an API endpoint from front-end (neighborhood from user's home city)
  - knn_data.csv: file produced as an output of an API endpoint from front-end (all neighborhoods in city being travelled to)
  - neighborhoods/
    - washingtondc_neighborhood_category_counts_transpose.csv: produced to save processing time on raw point of interest counts in neighborhoods
- src/ : front-end code directory
  - components
    - InputSelectorComponent.js
    - LeftContextCard.js
    - MapCard.js
    - MapComponent.js
    - PieChartComponent.js
    - PreferencesComponent.js
  - resources
    - *.json: Various geojson files used to render maps on front-end
  - App.js : main driver code for front-end application
  - App.css : project styling
  - Other various React framework files used that are pre-generated by npm. 
  
  

### Installation
No installation is needed, simply visit our web application. (https://main.d6ofziz7ed03g.amplifyapp.com/)
### Execution
* Visit https://main.d6ofziz7ed03g.amplifyapp.com/
* Run the following experiments to produce results:

#### Experiment 1
* Select Region: [Wicker Park], Activities: [Health Clubs & Gyms, Cafe], Time: [Morning]
* Let Results Load (this could take 5-10 minutes if running off of a cold start, which it probably will be. Normal usage runtime is 2-3 minutes) 
* View Results

#### Experiment 2
* Select Region: [Loop], Activities: [Parks, Museums], Time: [Afternoon]
* Let Results Load (this could take 5-10 minutes if running off of a cold start, which it probably will be. Normal usage runtime is 2-3 minutes) 
* View Results

NOTE: if experiments take longer than 10 minutes to run, please contact ecenteno3@gatech.edu or zcox6@gatech.edu. Our server may need to be reset.
